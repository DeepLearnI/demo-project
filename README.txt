Foundations project
===================

This project template was generated with "foundations init". In this project you'll find the following structure:


- Configuration
---------------

/config
    default.config.yaml

Configurations define how your job will run. This uses the local deployment type as default.


- Project code
--------------

/project_code
    driver.py
    model.py

The "project_code" directory is where all your model code should go, as well the driver file, which tells Foundations how to structure stages.

The driver should be used to set up the experiment. This is where you'll define stages for your experiments.

The model file is where your stages (python functions) will live.


- Post processing
-----------------

/post_processing
    results.py

If you want to read and interact with experiments you've run, you'll interact and analyze experiment results within the `post_processing` directory.


- Data
-------

/data


This is where you'll put the data to use in your model.
